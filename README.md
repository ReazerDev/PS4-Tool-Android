# PS4 Tool for Android
Open Surce Android Application to Inject Payloads to your PS4

# How To Use
Download any Payload you want to and open up the App. It's going to ask you for which PS4 Version the Payload you've downloaded is. You can choose between '1.76', '4.05' and '4.55'! These Versions are going to be updated if a new Kernel Exploit is being Released!

# Changing the App
Feel free to make any change on the Apps Design, Code etc. and Pull it. I'm going to see if the changes are ok or not and depending on my decision Accept the request.
